- 👋 Hi, I’m @refikorhun-NOAA
- 👀 I’m interested in the conservation aquaculture of groupers and IMTA (Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquacture)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on using effluent from fish hatcheries/farms to grow microalgae, heterotrophic bacteria, bivalves (oysters/clams) and seaweed
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a proposal to demonstrate spawning, larval rearing, and first juvenile production of red hind in Puerto Rico at DNER's marine fish hatchery currently under construction
- 📫 How to reach me via email...
- Of course this only a small part, i.e. ~10% of my overall activities inside of CFB-SFB. Currently I am managing a reefish smapling project to obtain life history (LH( data from unfished populations of species in South Florida which are heavily fished in the US Caribbean, i.e. parrotfishes, etc. Other aquaculture research is focused related on marine finfish candidate species for all US regions (Atlantic & Pacific) and especially more for the Caribbean region.  
- My main duties revolve around compiling commercial landings for the Gulf of Mexico (may be another year to hand over the Gulf of Mexico duties and focus more and more on the US Caribbean, i.e. USVI and Puerto Rico.
